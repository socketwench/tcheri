# TCHeRI -- Tiny Computer Home-extruded Rack Infrastructure

## Goals

Provide an infrastructure rack form factor which:
* Is aimed at the deadband between hobbist and professional uses
* Is highly customizable
* Can be built using a small amount of hand tools and a 3D printer
* Prints are small, can be individually printed, and done so with a minimum of support material
* Is functional, but also looks nice
* Is primarily (but not exclusively) aimed at small-form factor computing nodes (SBCs, miniPCs, etc.)

## Hardware

* Any ridgid 3D printer filament (PLA, PETG, ABS, etc.)
* Metric T-nuts and matching bolts (M3-M5, Button or Socket head style)
* Pre-fab rack rails
* 2020 Aluminum Extrusions

## Tools

* Hex keys
* Hacksaw
* Drill (some configurations!)
* 3D printer -- even a basic Ender will do

## WHY!?

Look, if you want a real rack, buy a real rack. Sometimes you can find used ones cheap. TCHeRI is intended for those who want something nicer than modified Ikea furnature and don't mind using their hands. You may also have weird functional or aesthic requirements which cannot be matched with off the shelf options.

## Sizes and form factors


500mm wide (19.68")
410mm deep (16.14")
590mm high (23.23")

Optional extrusion rails:
2x590mm pieces. Use the lefover 410 deep pieces as side cross-braces

2x1m pieces for wide parts
4x1m for deep and heigh parts
